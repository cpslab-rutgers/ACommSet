abstract = {The extreme and unpredictable underwater environment poses significant challenges in achieving reliable acoustic communications, mainly due to limited bandwidth and time-varying channels. In this study, we conducted multiple at-sea experiments to collect and evaluate underwater acoustic channels across various scenarios, including static and dynamic conditions, different frequency bands, and varying distances. The channel state information was estimated from the received Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing&nbsp;(OFDM) waveform. This information was then compiled into a dataset, called ACommSet, for the benefit of the larger research community, providing valuable empirical insights into the underwater acoustic channel. The background noise was also monitored along the channel information in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underwater acoustic environment. The ACommSet can be accessed by following the instructions given at the link: https://github.com/cpslab-rutgers/ACommSet.git},
